# 0x0C. Web server

## Tasks

## Mandatory
* 0 - Write a Bash script that transfers a file from our client to a server

* 1 - Install nginx web server

* 2 - Provide the domain name in your answer file

* 3 - Configure your Nginx server so that /redirect_me is redirecting to another page

* 4 - Configure your Nginx server to have a custom 404 page that contains the string Ceci n'est pas une page

## Advanced

* 5 - Design a beautiful 404 page

* 6 - Time to practice configuring your server with Puppet! Just as you did before, weâ€™d like you to install and configure an Nginx server using Puppet instead of Bash. To save time and effort, you should also include resources in your manifest to perform a 301 redirect when querying /redirect_me
